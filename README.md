<!-- Here a gif of choosing a currency and loading buff.163.com should be showed -->

## Development
On the 3rd of August 2022, the extension's development environment was drastically simplified. This means, we no longer use NPM, Rollup or Svelte.
It's simply plain vanilla JavaScript.

It is STRONGLY recommended to use `web-ext`, in order to automatically reload and package the extension.
### Setup
1. Clone the repo
	```sh
	git clone https://github.com/realwakils/buffcurrency.git
	cd buffcurrency
	```
2. Install and run web-ext (Optional)
	```sh
	npm install -g web-ext
	web-ext run -t chromium
	```
	
	Use the `--chromium-binary` and `--chromium-profile` flags, if you wish to use your own Chrome profile. By doing this you avoid having to login to Buff every time.
