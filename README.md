2. Find Buff Currency in your Chrome Extensions and choose the currency you

## Development

We recommended using Mozilla's excellent `web-ext`, in order to automatically
reload and package the extension.

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/realwakils/buffcurrency.git
   cd buffcurrency
   ```
2. Install `web-ext` globally
   ```sh
   npm install -g web-ext
   ```
3. Test the extension
   ```sh
   web-ext run -t chromium --url https://buff.163.com
   ```
   Use the `--chromium-binary` and `--chromium-profile` flags, if you wish
   to use your own Chrome profile. By doing this you avoid having to login
   to Buff every time.
